# Critical_Care_Study_Guide

Here are the essential concepts for your Critical Care Medicine rotation, organized by key domains:
Respiratory Failure & Mechanical Ventilation

Hypoxemic vs. hypercapnic respiratory failure - pathophysiology and approach
Ventilator modes: AC, SIMV, pressure support, APRV
Ventilator settings: FiO2, PEEP, tidal volumes (lung-protective ventilation: 6-8 mL/kg IBW)
ARDS management: Berlin criteria, prone positioning, PEEP strategies, neuromuscular blockade
Ventilator liberation: spontaneous breathing trials, extubation criteria
NIV indications: COPD exacerbations, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, immunocompromised patients

Shock & Hemodynamics

Four types of shock: distributive, cardiogenic, hypovolemic, obstructive
Hemodynamic monitoring: interpretation of CVP, ScvO2, lactate
Fluid resuscitation: crystalloid vs. colloid, balanced vs. unbalanced solutions
Vasopressors/inotropes: norepinephrine (first-line), vasopressin, epinephrine, dobutamine, milrinone
MAP goals: typically â‰¥65 mmHg (individualized for chronic hypertension)

Sepsis & Septic Shock

Sepsis-3 definitions: qSOFA, SOFA score
Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines:

Early recognition and 1-hour bundle
Fluid resuscitation (30 mL/kg crystalloid)
Broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour
Source control
Norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor



Neurological Critical Care

Altered mental status: CAM-ICU for delirium screening
Neuroprognostication post-cardiac arrest
Elevated ICP management: head of bed elevation, osmotic therapy (mannitol, hypertonic saline)
Seizure management: status epilepticus protocols
Stroke care: tPA criteria, thrombectomy windows

Renal & Metabolytes

AKI: KDIGO criteria, indications for RRT
RRT modalities: intermittent HD vs. CRRT
Electrolyte emergencies: hyperkalemia, severe hyponatremia/hypernatremia, hypercalcemia
Acid-base disorders: systematic approach using pH, PCO2, HCO3, anion gap

Sedation, Analgesia, & Delirium

ABCDEF bundle (PAD guidelines)
Sedation scales: RASS, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale
Medications: propofol, dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, remifentanil
Daily sedation interruption and spontaneous awakening trials
Delirium prevention: minimize benzodiazepines, early mobilization

Critical Procedures

Central line placement: internal jugular, subclavian, femoral
Arterial line placement and waveform interpretation
Endotracheal intubation: RSI medications, difficult airway algorithm
Chest tube placement
Lumbar puncture (though often consulting specialty)

Key ICU Emergencies

Tension pneumothorax: needle decompression
Massive hemoptysis: positioning, intubation considerations
Upper GI bleeding: resuscitation, octreotide, PPI, early endoscopy
Anaphylaxis: epinephrine IM/IV
Cardiac arrest: ACLS protocols

Preventive Care in ICU

DVT prophylaxis: pharmacologic and mechanical
Stress ulcer prophylaxis: for high-risk patients
VAP prevention: head of bed elevation, oral care, SATs/SBTs
CLABSI prevention: line necessity, sterile technique
ICU-acquired weakness: early mobilization

Special Populations

Post-cardiac arrest care: targeted temperature management, hemodynamic optimization
Acute coronary syndromes in ICU setting
Massive transfusion protocols: 1:1:1 ratio (RBC:FFP:platelets)
End-of-life discussions: goals of care, family meetings

Practical Tips:

Become comfortable with daily ICU rounds structure (systems-based)
Learn ventilator troubleshooting (high peak pressure, low tidal volumes, etc.)
Understand when to escalate vs. de-escalate care
Practice goals-of-care discussions early and often

Good luck with your rotation! The first few weeks can feel overwhelming, but focusing on these core concepts will give you a solid foundation.RetryDCprovide a study guide, that will help me prepare for these topicsArchitected comprehensive, evidence-based study guide for critical care preparation.The user is asking for a study guide to prepare for their Critical Care Medicine rotation. They want something structured that covers the key topics I mentioned. Given their preferences for evidence-based sources like UpToDate, Harrison's, NEJM, JAMA, and guidelines from major organizations (IDSA, ACC/AHA, etc.), I should create a comprehensive study guide that:

Is organized systematically
References high-quality, evidence-based resources
Includes specific articles, guidelines, and key trials
Is practical and focused on what they'll need for the rotation

I should create a document/artifact that they can use as a structured study plan. This would be best as a markdown file or similar document that they can reference.
Let me create a comprehensive study guide organized by topic with specific resources, landmark trials, and practical frameworks.I'll create a comprehensive study guide for you to prepare for your Critical Care rotation.Creating a comprehensive Critical Care Medicine study guide with evidence-based resources, landmark trials, and key guidelines for IM residency preparationCritical_Care_Study_Guide.mdSynthesized evidence-based critical care guide with landmark trials and guidelines.I've created a comprehensive Critical Care Medicine study guide for the user. This guide is evidence-based and includes references to major trials, guidelines, and high-quality sources as per their preferences (UpToDate, Harrison's, NEJM, JAMA, major organization guidelines).
The guide covers:
